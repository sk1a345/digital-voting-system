1. Big Picture: What Your App Is

A simple, secure system for voting.

There are two roles:

🧠 2. Admin — Responsibilities (What Admin CAN Do)

Admin is like an Election Commission officer.

Each candidate belongs to a party.

(Name, party, age, image, etc.)

✔ 4. Delete candidate

If removed from election.

✔ 5. View complete vote statistics

Party-wise vote count (optional)
